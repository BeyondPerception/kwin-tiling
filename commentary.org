* DONE Make rules for tiling
** DONE HACK Ignore yakuake and menus/dialogs for tiling
** DONE Add useractionsmenu
** TODO Find a way to share rules updates
* DONE Resize tiles
** TODO Buggy for bladelayout
** DONE Halflayout
** TODO Hacked/partial for Spirallayout
* DONE Floating
** DONE Toggle floating
** DONE Floating layout/disable script
** DONE Make floating windows be _above_ tilers
* TODO EDGECASES, EDGECASES, EDGECASES!
** TODO Doesn't tile properly when screen disappears
** DONE Don't tile fullscreen windows on workspace change
** DONE Windows can sometimes resize on their own (missing signal?)
   FTR: Nothing was actually done on geometryChanged
** TODO Focus-follows-mouse doesn't properly refocus on window kill (kwin bug or timing mishap?)
   Waiting on kwin
** DONE Tileindex not properly set on workspace switch
** DONE Check how windows on all desktops behave
** TODO Tabgroup
   Seems mostly working
** TODO MinSize
** TODO Resolution changes
   Almost possible, but clientArea returns the _old_ resolution
* DONE Avoid struts
  Almost finished, but doesn't directly react to changes
  Needs an additional kwin signal
** DONE Halflayout
** DONE Spirallayout
** DONE Bladelayout
* TODO Testing
** Weird apps (mplayer, gimp)
   Add those to rules by default
** Weird configurations
** Multi-monitor
** DONE Multiple workspaces (e.g. moving windows across, in floating and tiling mode)
** Crashes
** Graphic issues
   e.g. Steam doesn't update properly after resize
** Better release process (i.e. don't just pack up git, TEST)
* TODO Learning
** How to use the tests
** Javascript
* TODO Optimization
** TODO Refactor layouts to share more code
* TODO Crazy stuff
** DONE Animate all windows on move
   Hacked by simply _doing_ the move
** Layout switcher
** Indicate layout/state (tiling on/off) somehow
** Per-activity settings
   Huge complexity increase (one additional layer on top of desktops/screens)
   Investigate how the actual relationship between activities and desktops/clients is
** DONE Minimize stack
   Maybe something for a different script (or just unminimize last minimized window)
   Made it a different script
