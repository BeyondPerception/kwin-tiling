* TODO Make rules for tiling
** HACK Ignore yakuake and menus/dialogs for tiling
* TODO Resize tiles
* TODO Floating
** DONE Toggle floating
   Somehow client.tiling_floating stays the same across acesses (fixed?)
** DONE Floating layout/disable script
   *** Currently moves and resizes windows on disable
** DONE Make floating windows be _above_ tilers
   Somehow accessing client.keepAbove doesn't work
   Make configurable?
* TODO EDGECASES, EDGECASES, EDGECASES!
** TODO Doesn't tile properly when screen disappears
** TODO Don't tile fullscreen windows on workspace change
** TODO Windows can sometimes resize on their own (missing signal?)
** TODO Focus-follows-mouse doesn't properly refocus on window kill (kwin bug or timing mishap?)
* DONE Killing three clients in succession without opening another in between kills the script
** This was the result of removing an element from an array and afterwards accessing it by index
* DONE Retile on minimize

* TODO Testing
** Weird apps (mplayer, gimp)
** Weird configurations
** Multi-monitor (semi-tested right now)

* TODO Learning
** How to add configuration
** How to use the tests
** Javascript

* TODO Optimization
* TODO Crazy stuff
  ** Overlap titlebars and abuse keepAbove to save space?
  Can we even get the size of a window _without_ titlebar?
