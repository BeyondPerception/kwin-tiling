* DONE Make rules for tiling
** DONE HACK Ignore yakuake and menus/dialogs for tiling
** DONE Add useractionsmenu
** TODO Find a way to share rules updates
* DONE Resize tiles
** TODO Hacked/partial for Spirallayout
* TODO EDGECASES, EDGECASES, EDGECASES!
** TODO Doesn't tile properly when screen disappears
** DONE Windows can sometimes resize on their own (missing signal?)
   FTR: Nothing was actually done on geometryChanged
** DONE Focus-follows-mouse doesn't properly refocus on window kill (kwin bug or timing mishap?)
   Waiting on kwin
   Worked around by using windowClosed instead of clientRemoved
** DONE Tabgroup
   Seems mostly working
** DONE MinSize
   This leads to graphics bugs
** TODO Resolution changes
   Almost possible, but clientArea returns the _old_ resolution
* DONE Avoid struts
  Almost finished, but doesn't directly react to changes
  Needs an additional kwin signal
** DONE Halflayout
** DONE Spirallayout
** DONE Bladelayout
* TODO Testing
** Weird apps (mplayer, gimp)
   Add those to rules by default
** Weird configurations
** Multi-monitor
** DONE Multiple workspaces (e.g. moving windows across, in floating and tiling mode)
** Crashes
** DONE Graphic issues
   e.g. Steam doesn't update properly after resize
** Better release process (i.e. don't just pack up git, TEST)
* TODO Learning
** How to use the tests
** Javascript
* TODO Optimization
** TODO Refactor layouts to share more code
* TODO Crazy stuff
** Layout switcher
** Indicate layout/state (tiling on/off) somehow
** Per-activity settings
   Huge complexity increase (one additional layer on top of desktops/screens)
   Investigate how the actual relationship between activities and desktops/clients is
   Seems to be the following:
   Each client belongs to multiple activities, but is on the same desktop on each
   There can only be one activity at the same time
*** Needs changes in tilingmanager (large) and maybe tile and tilelist
* TODO Report
** Bugs
*** ClientArea doesn't update
*** Pixmap issue
*** no tabGroup
*** windowClosed's "deleted" not properly converted
** Documentation
*** ClientArea options
*** conditions/guarantees (e.g. is windowClosed always executed before FFM selects new activeClient?)
** Wishes
*** Integration with rules
