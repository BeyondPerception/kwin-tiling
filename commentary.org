* DONE Make rules for tiling
** DONE HACK Ignore yakuake and menus/dialogs for tiling
** DONE Add useractionsmenu
* DONE Resize tiles
  Hacked for Spirallayout, working for Halflayout
* DONE Floating
** DONE Toggle floating
   Somehow client.tiling_floating stays the same across acesses (fixed?)
** DONE Floating layout/disable script
   Currently moves and resizes windows on disable
** DONE Make floating windows be _above_ tilers
   Somehow accessing client.keepAbove doesn't work
   Make configurable?
   Curently floating windows are still handled somehow
* TODO EDGECASES, EDGECASES, EDGECASES!
** TODO Doesn't tile properly when screen disappears
** DONE Don't tile fullscreen windows on workspace change
** DONE Windows can sometimes resize on their own (missing signal?)
** TODO Focus-follows-mouse doesn't properly refocus on window kill (kwin bug or timing mishap?)
   Waiting on kwin
** TODO Tileindex not properly set on workspace switch
** TODO Check how windows on all desktops behave
** TODO Tabgroups
* DONE Retile on minimize
* DONE Avoid struts
  Never noticed because I set the panel to autohide
** DONE Halflayout
** DONE Spirallayout
** DONE Bladelayout
* TODO Testing
** Weird apps (mplayer, gimp)
** Weird configurations
** Multi-monitor (semi-tested right now)
** Multiple workspaces (e.g. moving windows across, in floating and tiling mode)
* TODO Learning
** How to use the tests
** Javascript
* TODO Optimization
** TODO Refactor layouts to share more code
* TODO Crazy stuff
** Animate all windows on move
   The outline currently flickers, but shows
** Layout switcher
** Indicate layout/state (tiling on/off) somehow
** Per-activity settings
   Huge complexity increase (one additional layer on top of desktops/screens)
   Investigate how the actual relationship between activities and desktops/clients is
** DONE Minimize stack
   Maybe something for a different script (or just unminimize last minimized window)
   Made it a different script
